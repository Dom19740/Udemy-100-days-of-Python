# Project Name
Two Player Snake Game

## Info
This was built from Day 20 of the Udemy 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. The goal of the lesson was to implement your own version of the classic snake game, but I decided to develop it further into a 2 player game.

The lesson utilised animation & coorditnates, OOP in Python, along with inheritance and list slicing.
